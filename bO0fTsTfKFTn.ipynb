Description\\n\",","    \"Deep image prior, a neural network with proven results in standard inverse problems, is used to determine the state of a physical system. It is a fully unsupervised model which acts as implicit regularization in the variational data assimilation method. The algorithm is demonstrated with a shallow-water toy model and the simulated observations are compared with variational assimilation without regularization, with Tikhonov regularization and with deep prior.\\n\",","    \"\\n\",","    \"### Highlights\\n\",","    \"* Fetch the modelling codebase from the GitHub repo provided with the paper.\\n\",","    \"* Run the main Python script to generate sample observations from a shallow-water model and variational assimilation solutions.\\n\",","    \"* Recreate visualizations from the paper.\\n\",","    \"* Compare assimilation scores and
